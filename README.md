English / [Japanese](./README_jp.md)

This is an MCP server that creates an environment for an avatar to virtually travel on Google Maps.

From an MCP client such as Claude Desktop, you can give instructions to the avatar and report on the progress of its journey with photos.

<img alt="img_5.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_5.png" width="400"/>

> Added gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview (nano-banana) to travel image generation  

Support for nano-banana has been added. Nano-banana's semantic mask allows you to generate composite travel images in a short time without setting remBg.  

> Supports both Streamable-HTTP and stdio (compliant with Smithery.ai's config interface)  

It can be used as a stdio-type MCP as before, or as Streamable-HTTP.  
Although it supports multiple users, the database API must be specified per session using the Smithery.ai config interface.  
Since it supports both Streamable-HTTP and stdio, it is expected to work as is with the previous MCP client, but if you use the previous stdio version, please use v0.0.x (v0.0.81).  
``` npx -y @mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp@0.0.81 ```  

> Now supports librechat https://www.librechat.ai/.

> Now supports Smithery https://smithery.ai/server/@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp (images are excluded because they are heavy to run).

> Now verified MseeP https://mseep.ai/app/mfukushim-map-traveler-mcp 

## Functions

#### MCP server tools function

The following functions can be used as an MCP server. The available functions vary depending on the settings and execution state.

You can specify the function name directly, but Claude LLM will automatically recognize it, so you can specify the operation in general terms.

Example:
"Where are you now?" "Let's leave for Tokyo Station."

- get_traveler_view_info(includePhoto:boolean,includeNearbyFacilities:boolean)  
  Gets information about the current travel avatar's location.  
  - includePhoto: Gets nearby Google Street View photos. If you have set up an image generation AI, it will synthesize the avatar.
  - includeNearbyFacilities: Gets information about nearby facilities.
- get_traveler_location()  
  Gets information about the current travel avatar's address and nearby facilities.
- reach_a_percentage_of_destination()
  Reach a specified percentage of the destination (moveMode=skip only)
  timeElapsedPercentage: Percent progress towards destination(0~100)
- set_traveler_location(address: string)  
  Sets the current travel avatar's location.
  - address: Address information (exact address, or general name that Google Maps or Claude can recognize, etc.)
- get_traveler_destination_address  
  Get the destination of the travel avatar you set
- set_traveler_destination_address(address: string)

#### MCP resources

Has five custom prompt samples.
When you import a prompt with Claude Desktop, Claude will act as a traveler.
The SNS-compatible version controls SNS input and output while having a travel conversation.

- role.txt  
  Claude will act as a traveler.

- roleWithSns.txt  
  Claude will act as a traveler. It also controls reading and posting to SNS.
- carBattle.txt  
  This is a small novel game about a story of transporting secret documents from Yokohama to Tokyo. Scenes are automatically generated. Set moveMode=skip to play.
- japanMapChallenge.txt,japanMapChallenge2.txt  
  Two AIs communicate with each other via SNS and play a challenge game using landscape images.  
  To play, you need two Bluesky accounts and two Claude Desktops. Also set moveMode=skip. (However, the operation is somewhat unstable.)  
  japanMapChallenge2 has a challenge reflection rule.

## Setting

You will need to obtain and set access keys for multiple APIs, such as for accessing multiple Google maps and generating images.
Use of the API may incur charges.

- claude_desktop_config.json (streamable-http type)  
The above MT_ environment variables should be set as environment variables for the server that runs the map-traveler-mcp web service.  
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "traveler": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://(mcp server address)/mcp?config=(base64 config json)"
    }
  }
}
```  

base64 config json (Smithery.ai Expansion)  
By concatenating the json in the following format into a single line of string, converting it to base64, and setting it as (base64 setting json), you can overwrite different APIs and settings for each user session.  
If the database is not set base64 config json, it will be shared across the entire service (the location of the traveler will be shared across the database and counted for one person).  
We plan to reconsider the operation of assigning an individual UserId for each session once the MCP authentication mechanism has become a little clearer.

```


> NOTE: The environment variables have been renamed to standard snake case. The MT_ prefix is added because they may be used in conjunction with other environment variables, such as in librechat. The old names can still be used for backward compatibility.  

Please set the following three Credentials for Google Map API.  
- Street View Static API
- Places API (New)
- Time Zone API
- Directions API

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/get-api-key

If you want to use the image generation AI, set either pixAi_key or sd_key. You also need to have python3.7~3.11 installed on your PC and rembg cli installed (virtual environment recommended).

https://platform.pixai.art/docs  
https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/SDXL-1.0-and-SD1.6/operation/textToImage

The bluesky SNS address/password are optional. It is recommended that you create a dedicated account as it will post automatically.

https://bsky.app/

You can also run it in practice mode, which does not require an API key for verification.

#### Practice mode settings  
claude_desktop_config.json
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "traveler": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How to use

#### Use the practice mode

1. Install nodejs 22.

2. Set up Claude Desktop for use.

3. Reflect one of the above settings in claude_desktop_config.json.

4. Restart Claude Desktop. It may take some time to set up (if an error occurs, try restarting Claude Desktop again. If it doesn't work, see the notes below). Make sure the following mark appears in the bottom right of the screen.

  <img alt="img_1.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_1.png" width="150"/>

5. Ask "Where are you now?" and "Go on a journey." A conversation will begin. When using the API, a confirmation screen will appear, so select Allow.

<img alt="img_4.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_4.png" width="200"/>

6. Select Attach from MCP and select role.txt.

<img alt="img_2.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_2.png" width="200"/>

<img alt="img_3.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_3.png" width="200"/>

7. A travel prompt has been built in, so feel free to talk to it.

#### Use the full feature

1. Get a Google Map API access key and set the permissions for Street View Static API, Places API (New), Time Zone API, and Directions API. Set this in the env of claude_desktop_config.json and restart.
   At this point, the travel log will be based on the real map. Travel images will also be output if they are not superimposed.
2. Decide on a path that will not interfere with the disk and set it in the sqlite_path of the env of claude_desktop_config.json. (Example: %USERPROFILE%/Desktop/traveler.sqlite $HOME/Documents/traveler.sqlite, etc.)
   At this point, your travel log will be saved and you can continue your journey even if you close Claude Desktop.
3. Install python 3.7 to 3.11 and install rembg with cli. We recommend using a virtual environment such as venv.
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  . venv/bin/activate or .\venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install "rembg[cpu,cli]"
  ```
  Check if rembg cli works properly using a sample image file. Input an image with a person in it, and if the person is cut out in the output file, it's OK.  
  ```bash
  rembg i source_image_file dest_image_file
  ```
4. rembg cli will be installed in the python exe location, so get the path. The file location varies depending on the OS and python installation status, but in the case of venv, it is (virtual environment name)\Scripts\rembg.exe or (virtual environment name)/bin/rembg above the directory you set. If you can't find it, search for the path with a file search software. Set that path to rembg_path of env in claude_desktop_config.json. (Example: "rembg_path": "C:\\Users\\xxxx\\Documents\\rembg_venv\\venv\\Scripts\\rembg.exe")
5. Get an image generation API key from the pixAI or Stability.ai site. Set the key to pixAi_key or sd_key in env of claude_desktop_config.json.
   The avatar will now be overlaid on the travel image.
6. Get the bluesky SNS address/password and handle name. Set these in bs_id, bs_pass, and bs_handle in env of claude_desktop_config.json, respectively.
   Import the travel knowledge prompt roleWithSns.txt to report travel actions to SNS (it will automatically post as a bot, so we recommend allocating a dedicated account)

Instead of preparing rembg with the cli, we have added a setting that allows you to handle rembg as a service API.  
If you configure the following rembg service, you can use rembg by setting the URL in remBgUrl.  

https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg?tab=readme-ov-file#rembg-s  

Setup is simple if you use the Docker version to launch a container and access it.  

https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-as-a-docker  

#### Use Turso libsql API for configuration database

If you want to use the cloud API Turso libsql (https://turso.tech/libsql) without having a local sqlite file, sign up for Turso and allocate a sqlite database (paid, free tier available).   
This add-in will automatically configure (migrate) the database.  
MT_TURSO_URL = turso db URL  
MT_TURSO_TOKEN = turso db access token  


#### Use Cloud API for rembg

Local settings around rembg are complicated no matter what method you use, but we have added settings for the paid cloud rembg (https://withoutbg.com/).  
> Note: There is a small free trial available, but please be aware that this is a commercial API and is quite expensive (about 0.1 euros per image).

MT_REMBG_WO_KEY = withoutbg access token


#### When using external ComfyUI (for more advanced users)

You can also use a local ComfyUI as an image generation server. You can configure the image generation characteristics yourself in detail to reduce API costs.

However, the configuration will be quite complicated and image generation may take longer.

1. Configure ComfyUI to run in API mode.
2. Set the server URL to comfy_url in env.
3. Set detailed configuration values such as the model to be used in env in the form of a json string.
example.
```json
{
  "env": {
    "comfy_url": "http://192.168.1.100:8188",
    "comfy_workflow_t2i": "C:\\Documents\\t2itest.json",
    "comfy_workflow_i2i":"C:\\Documents\\i2itest.json",
    "comfy_params":"ckpt_name='animagineXL40_v40.safetensors',denoise=0.65"
  }
}
```
4. The default workflow can use assets/comfy/t2i_sample.json and assets/comfy/i2i_sample.json in the package. You can specify variables using % and specify the variables in comfy_params.

## Using libreChat

It has been adapted to work with libreChat. This makes it easier to use, but some additional settings are required.  
Also, it seems that it will not be stable unless the PC you use has a decent level of performance, such as one that can stably run Docker.

#### Install libreChat  

Please make sure it works as described on the official website.  
In this case, we recommend using Docker configuration due to additional settings.

https://www.librechat.ai/docs/local/docker  

Configure librechat.yaml using the official procedure.  
I think you will need to add a local or API LLM service.  

https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml  

Add a user for login.  

https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/authentication#create-user-script  

Please set it so that you can have general chat conversations.  

#### Add a rembg container with additional settings  

To use rembg with Docker, add pulling and running the rembg Docker container.  

docker-compose.override.yml
```yml
 services:
   api:
     volumes:
       - type: bind
         source: ./librechat.yaml
         target: /app/librechat.yaml

   rembg:
     image: danielgatis/rembg:latest
     restart: always
     command: "s --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000 --log_level info"

```

#### Add map-traveler-mcp to the MCP service  

Add librechat.yaml
```yaml
mcpServers:
  traveler:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - "@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp"
```

Add .env (Same as env in claude_desktop_config.json)

```env
# map-traveler-mcp
GoogleMapApi_key=(Google Map API key)
sqlite_path=/home/run_test.sqlite (e.g. librechat in an unobtrusive location inside the container, or in an external directory that you don't want to mount.)
remBgUrl=http://rembg:7000 (rembg Service API URL, container URL)
(Other settings such as image generation AI settings, PixAI key, stability.ai API key, ComfyUI settings, etc.)

```

After setting, restart the container.  
On slow PCs, mcp initialization may fail. Multiple restarts may work, but this may be difficult to run...

#### llibreChat settings

To use the MCP function in libreChat, use the Agents function.  

1. On the conversation screen, select Agents.  
   <img alt="libre1.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre1.png" width="200"/>
2. Select Agent Builder from the panel on the right side of the screen and configure your agent.  
   <img alt="libre2.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre2.png" width="200"/>
3. Select Add Tools to use map-traveler.  
   <img alt="libre3.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre3.png" width="200"/>
4. The agent tools screen will appear, so select and add all the map-traveler-mcp tools (if the map-traveler-mcp tools are not listed, MCP initialization has failed, so please restart the container or review the settings by checking the logs, etc.)  
   <img alt="libre4.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre4.png" width="200"/>  
   <img alt="libre5.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre5.png" width="200"/>  
5. Enter additional script in the instruction area.  
   Since libreChat does not have the MCP resource function, enter the content text of the following URL into the instruction area instead.   
   https://github.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/blob/main/assets/scenario/role.txt  
   <img alt="libre7.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre7.png" width="200"/>  
6. Click the Create button to save the agent.  
   <img alt="libre6.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre6.png" width="200"/>
7. Start a new chat.

## Smithery

Please refer to https://smithery.ai/server/@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp.  
Remote MCP (Streamable-http mode) is supported. Image generation is only available on nano-banana.  
Database settings can now be recorded with Turso sqlite, so if you configure Turso, your travel progress will also be saved.

I use Effect.ts to simplify error management & for my own learning.  
We also use the Effect Service, but due to the way MCP calls work, we believe that consolidating it using the Service was not optimal.  
I think it would be simpler to handle the MCP calls directly in the Effect.  
Addendum: I'm aware that I will be able to reconsider how to use the Effect Service and rewrite it neatly, but I'm still considering whether to rewrite it.  

#### Notes on the latest updates

- Added image_width to env. The default is 512. Setting it smaller may reduce the cost of LLM API.  
- Added an env setting that does not output images for MCP clients that do not have image input/output.  
"MT_NO_IMAGE": "true" will not generate or output any images. Other image-related settings can be omitted.  
```
{
  
  "env": {
    "MT_NO_IMAGE": "true"
  }
  
}
or
{
  
  "env": {
    "GoogleMapApi_key": "xxxx",
    "MT_NO_IMAGE": "true"
  }
  
}

```  
- You can now specify the tag name to be added when posting to SNS (Bluesky). #Required and must be at least 15 characters. If not specified, it will become "#geo_less_traveler".  
- The information obtained from SNS has been slightly changed. The information posted to SNS has been slightly changed.  
- A script has been added that allows multiple travel bots to converse and play via SNS.  

- Supports remote use from Smithery.  
  If you do not want to configure detailed settings, start the app in practice mode.
  You can also run the app at full speed by configuring each cloud API, but please be aware of charges as it uses many paid APIs such as rembg API.
  If you do not want to synthesize avatars, you can run the app with the minimum settings of Google Map API and Turso sqlite API.

- Added the MT_NO_AVATAR option.  
  If set, an avatar image will not be composited onto the landscape image. Since there will be no retry processing for avatar composition, the time it takes to obtain a response will be significantly shorter.  
  Set this option if image composition is slow or fails unavoidably.

- Partially applied MCP version 2025-06-18.  
  I added title to the schema. I plan to apply outputSchema and structured response in the future, but I haven't implemented them this time. Since the output of Travel Bot is simple text, I don't think structuring is necessary yet.

- Fixed an issue where some functions, such as SNS functions, could not be called regardless of the env settings due to an initialization error.  

- Added support for Streamable-http. This was done in a hurry, so if you experience any issues, please consider using version 0.0.81 or similar.  

- Support for nano-banana (gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview) image generation has been added. When using nano-banana, no rembg settings are required. The characteristics of the avatar prompt have changed, so image generation may fail with the previous avatar prompt. In this case, you will need to adjust the avatar appearance prompt to one that is acceptable for nano-banana.

- When generating images for nano-banana, you can now reference the original character image with MT_AVATAR_IMAGE_URI. Please use it in a way that does not infringe on copyrights.
